# PandasPentesterTutorial

This collection of notebooks will give introductions (101) and more advanced (102) examples, how to __wrangle, process and visualize__ BugBounty Recon Data.

It introduces:
  * Pandas - for Data Wrangling, Exploration and Processing
  * ipywidgets - to assess and structure the collected and cleaned data
  * bokeh - to visualize geographical locations of servers
  * neo4j and vis.js - to visualize the relationship between IP addresses, domains, portscans and directorytraversals
  
## How to use  
  
All these visualization techniques are executable and viewable inside a JupyterNotebook or JupyterLab. The included __dockerfile__ provides all libraries, settings and extensions to run all notebooks. You should use this command to run the container after building it:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes \
-v <your path>/PandasPentesterTutorial:/home/jovyan/work <your container name>:latest
```

It forwards additionally the port 8000 for being able to provide Reveal.js slides of the notebooks.

Have fun.
